# Jupiter_Backend
This project called Jupiter I did in Spring 2021 with the help of Laioffer Inc. is a personalized twitch resources recommendation engine. 
The following can help to explain the description of the porject:
1. Designed and built a full-stack web application for users to search twitch resources (stream/video/clip) and get recommendations. 
2. Built a web page with rich + user friendly experience using React and Ant Design
3. Implemented RESTful APIs using Java servlets, retrieved real Twitch resources using Twitch API and stored data in MySQL.
4. Support login/logout and favorite collection.
5. Explored multiple recommendation algorithms and extracted game information from Twitch resources to implement a Content-based algorithm.
6. Deployed the service to AWS EC2 for better stability.
